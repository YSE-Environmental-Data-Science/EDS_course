## Updating the website

**Step 1:** Assuming that you already have the repo [cloned](https://lter.github.io/workshop-github/rstudio.html#cloning-a-repository) to your computer, make and save your changes to the .qmd files or any other file in RStudio. 

**Step 2:** Navigate to the **Build** tab in the upper right-hand corner. Click **Render Website**. The html files that make up the course website will be created momentarily.

**Step 3:** Navigate to the **Git** tab that is next to the **Build** tab. [Stage, commit, and push](https://lter.github.io/workshop-github/rstudio.html#workflow-refresher) those new html files to GitHub. 

**Step 4:** The website should be updated at https://yse-environmental-data-science.github.io/EDS_course/.
