Here is a partial list of data repositories where you can find datasets on nearly every subject in environmental science. This list is credited to the LTER Network's [Synthesis Skills for Early Career Researchers (SSECR) course](lter.github.io/ssecr/) and [Ecological Data Synthesis: A Primer on Essential Methods course](https://lter.github.io/eco-data-synth-primer/). The data repository's associated R package is listed as well. The R packages can be installed from either CRAN or GitHub.
